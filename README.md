SPI library for Raspberry Pi and Erlang
==========================

This is a simple wrapper around (part of) the functions of the [WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/) library for Raspberry Pi: it allows interaction with SPI devices. The two examples interact with a MSP3002 ADC IC and a SN74HC595 shift register IC.
